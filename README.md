## About CS50AI

[CS50AI](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) is Harvard University's introduction to artificial intelligence. It goes through a lot of things, such as search algorithms, machine learning, neural networks, and more. Like CS50x, it's free for everyone and I highly recommend taking it.
<br><br> Feel free to explore my projects and take inspiration, but please do not copy anything!

## Acknowledgments
Thanks again to Harvard University and CS50's staff for providing this excellent course material and learning experience, this was a great time for me and I enjoyed it a lot! Especially the Neural Network Lecture and the corresponding Project of identifying road signs with a CNN.
